This is a new file in my hello-world git repo... 
I'm writing this on hte laptop, and going to 
commit it first to my local copy, 
and the see about uploading it to github.

I'm now adding some more text in the  'testex' branch
IT'll be interesting to see how it turns out, merging everything
in to the master branch and seeing it back on github.
