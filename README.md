# hello-world
Just the Github tutorial.

### Just getting round to this at last.
* Create some Files. 
* Commit them to git.
* Track changes.

#### Here starts the edits branch. 
* Writing this stuff is:
  * fun
  * exciting
  * low fat

You can also look at the [hello2.txt](./hello2.txt) --not sure that link will work,
but besides, there's another file in the repo now, and I'm going to edit it some more.
